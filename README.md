# SMS Classifier

A simple yet powerful web application designed to classify SMS messages as either **Spam** or **Ham** (not spam). Built with Python, this project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to provide accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Real-time Classification**: Instantly classifies SMS messages entered by the user.
-   **Text Preprocessing**: Automatically cleans and processes text (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) for better accuracy.
-   **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a trained model (likely Naive Bayes or similar) and TF-IDF vectorization.
